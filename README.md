web-thang
=========

Yet another website / web app template to kick-start my web-based, toy projects.

After cloning and removing the .git folder:

```sh
  git init
  git remote add origin PATH/TO/NEW/REPO
  git fetch
  git checkout -t origin/master
```

(see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2411031/how-do-i-clone-into-a-non-empty-directory)

As far as the name is concerned, I initially couldn't decide on whether I wanted to use this to build *websites* or *web
apps*. Then, I realised I couldn't make much difference between those two terms anyway. Finally, I came across **[By any
other name](https://adactio.com/journal/6246/)** by *Jeremy Keith*, that suggested the perfect name :) .
